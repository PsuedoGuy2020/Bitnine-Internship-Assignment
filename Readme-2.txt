# Fibonacci Sequence Calculation

This program calculates the Fibonacci sequence using three different approaches: recursive, iterative, and dynamic programming.

1) Development Environment
> To compile and run the code, you'll need:
- Language: C
- Compiler: gcc (GNU Compiler Collection)
- Operating System: Windows, macOS, Linux

2) Compilation and Execution
> Follow the steps below to compile and run the source code:
. Open a text editor and copy the source code into a new file.
. Save the file with a ".c" extension, for example, "fibonacci.c".
. Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where you saved the source file.
. Run the following command to compile the source code:
  gcc program_2.c -o program_2 
  This command uses the gcc compiler to compile the source code and creates an executable file named "fibonacci".
. Once the compilation is successful, run the program by executing the following command:
 ./program_2
. This command executes the compiled program and displays the output on the command prompt or terminal.
. The program will calculate the Fibonacci numbers using the recursive, iterative, and dynamic programming approaches for the input value specified in the "num" variable. The results will be displayed on the screen.

> Example Output
. For the input value num = 20, the program will display the following output:
  F(20) = 6765
  F(20) = 6765
  F(20) = 6765
. This indicates that the 20th Fibonacci number calculated using the recursive approach is 6765, using the iterative approach is 10946, and using the dynamic programming approach is also 6765.

3) Code Description
. The program provides three different approaches to calculate the Fibonacci sequence and demonstrates their advantages and disadvantages. You can modify the value of the "num" variable to calculate the Fibonacci numbers for different input values.
